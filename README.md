# EDA-on-Unicorn-Companies

Description
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about unicorn companies—startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more. The dataset includes details such as company name, valuation, funding, industry, location, and more. The goal of the analysis is to derive insights into the unicorn ecosystem and provide strategic recommendations for stakeholders, including investors and entrepreneurs.

Steps Taken
•	Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
•	Ensured data types were appropriate for analysis.
•	Cleaned and standardized column names.
•	Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses of key features.
•	Generated insights on funding trends, valuation distribution, industry dynamics, and geographic distribution of unicorn companies.
•	Plotted bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and more to represent various aspects of the dataset.

Challenges Faced:
•	Handling diverse data types and ensuring consistency.
•	Dealing with outliers and extreme values in funding and valuation.
•	Incorporating time-based analysis and handling date-related challenges.
